## Biography

I have decided to finally take the bull by the horns and just start a blog! It is advice that I have come across online on twitter and online. 
Primarily to keep track of the things I am learning. Hopefully will stop me going round in circles.
I have a plethora of files and scripts that I can never find when I am looking for them. 

My aims:

- to keep track of everything I am doing and to be able to quicky locate a file  
- to learn more and to have what I learn engrained in my brain! (although it is encouraging that experts in the field do not recall absolutely everything they know instantly! that of course is not to say that they dont know a hell of a lot.). There are so so many packages and functions and things to try out. 
- to try out the Feyman technique for learning. I came across this on a blog on Datacamp I think. Basically you learn by being able to explain in your own words what you have learned. This of course is my interpretation of they Feyamn technique!   
- to be able to organise my work better  
-  to be able to write clearly  


I intend to find interesting (to me at least) examples of topics that interest me and try them out on my own examples. Thus learning in a more applied sense than just reading a book or article. Be able to write up freely.

I think I should write this as if soemone else may read it. Althoiugh this is unlikely!
