I have decided to take the advice I keep coming across on twitter to start a blog and document your learning.
The main reason for me is to keep track of the various courses and projects I am working on and have one central place to find everything as I spend far too much time trying to find something I have done before! I started building the blog 2 months ago but then went back to other courses and tutorials and projects which I have kept locally on my computer. But there are oh so many files now that I forget what I have done or where I have put something. Therefore from now on I am going to record everything I do on this page, including how I am building this page. This might save me a lot of time in the future.
The future me in 2 months time wont have to spend time staring at a tiny screen trying to locate a file!
