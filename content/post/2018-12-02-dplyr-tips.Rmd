here I am going to put all the different things I have learned in dplyr for easy reference.

more tips from Rladies, #rstats etc from twitter or just new things to me!

`%T>%`  from `magrittr` where you can print or some other function with pipes without breaking up your code

`plotly`  can create plot in ggplot and then put it in a call to plotly  `plotly::ggplotly` to create interactive graphics

`View` has a `title` argument you can supply.


if `count` does not work make sure that `plyr` package has not been loaded after `dplyr` as it also has a `count` function.
restart your r session and make sure that the `dplyr` package is loaded after `plyr` and not before.
