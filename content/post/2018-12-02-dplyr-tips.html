<p>here I am going to put all the different things I have learned in dplyr for easy reference.</p>
<p>more tips from Rladies, #rstats etc from twitter or just new things to me!</p>
<p><code>%T&gt;%</code> from <code>magrittr</code> where you can print or some other function with pipes without breaking up your code</p>
<p><code>plotly</code> can create plot in ggplot and then put it in a call to plotly <code>plotly::ggplotly</code> to create interactive graphics</p>
<p><code>View</code> has a <code>title</code> argument you can supply.</p>
<p>if <code>count</code> does not work make sure that <code>plyr</code> package has not been loaded after <code>dplyr</code> as it also has a <code>count</code> function. restart your r session and make sure that the <code>dplyr</code> package is loaded after <code>plyr</code> and not before.</p>
