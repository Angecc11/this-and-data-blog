      <description>I have decided to take the advice I keep coming across on twitter to start a blog and document your learning. The main reason for me is to keep track of the various courses and projects I am working on and have one central place to find everything as I spend far too much time trying to find something I have done before! I started building the blog 2 months ago but then went back to other courses and tutorials and projects which I have kept locally on my computer.</description>
