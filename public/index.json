The geniusr package by Ewenme provide tools for working directly in R with the Genius API. You first need to authenticate to be able to use this package. See [Github repo] (“https://github.com/ewenme/geniusr”) instructions on how to create a Genius API client and to generate an access token. You can then setyour credentials in the System Environment variable GENIUS_API_TOKEN by calling the genius_token() function and entering your Genius Client Access Token when prompted. As with all api tokens this should be kept somewhere private. To use the package you will need to load the geniusr library and call the genius_token() function when prompted. If you try to use a function without entering your credentials you may notice a prompt in the console ‘Please enter your Genius Client Access Token and press enter:’ as it waits for your access token to be entered\nthe geniusr package get_album_meta(album_id = 337082)  A tibble: 1 x 9 album_id album_name album_url album_cover_art_url album_release_d… pageviews artist_id artist_name artist_url\n        \n1 337082 DAMN. https://geniu… https://images.genius.c… 2017-04-14 35922767 1421 Kendrick L… https://geniu…\n library(geniusr) library(dplyr) library(tidytext) There are instructions on how to use the geniusr package in the readme.md file on github (“https://github.com/ewenme/geniusr”)\nlibrary(geniusr) library(dplyr) library(tidytext) # Get song search results for the term \u0026#39;good morning\u0026#39; gm_search \u0026lt;- search_song(search_term = \u0026quot;good morning\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% # look for Kanye as the primary artist filter(artist_name == \u0026quot;Kanye West\u0026quot;) gm_search  A tibble: 1 x 5 song_id song_name song_lyrics_url artist_id artist_name     \n1 1428 Good Morning https://genius.com/Kanye-west-good-morning-lyrics 72 Kanye West\n # get lyrics gm_lyrics \u0026lt;- scrape_lyrics_id(song_id = gm_search$song_id) gm_lyrics  A tibble: 53 x 5 line song_id song_name artist_id artist_name     \n1 Uhh.. uhh 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 2 Uhh.. uhh 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 3 Good morning! 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 4 Good morning! 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 5 Good morning! 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 6 Good morning! 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 7 Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 8 Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he’s so impressed 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 9 I mean damn, did you even see the test? 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West 10 You got D’s, muthafucka D’s, Rosie Perez 1428 Good Morning 72 Kanye West # … with 43 more rows\n # tokenization of the lyrics gm_lyrics %\u0026gt;% # get bigrams unnest_tokens(bigram, line, token = \u0026quot;ngrams\u0026quot;, n = 2) %\u0026gt;% # count bigram frequency count(bigram) %\u0026gt;% # look for good morning filter(bigram == \u0026quot;good morning\u0026quot;)  A tibble: 1 x 2 bigram n   1 good morning 18\n However I am getting some errors when trying to get the lyrics for particular song ids.

Some of the ones that I like are Beautiful Hugo, Blackburn and also Academic but I feel that I am not academic enough to be using Academic! What I want is a simple page where I keep my learning efforts / posts and be able to find them easily. The Academic theme seems to have a section with a menu on the right that is easy to navigate. I could just remove the sections that are not relevant to me.\ncontinuous deployment I had problems on an earlier version of the blog where continuous deployment was failing. For this version I started a new project using the git version control option and copied the git repository url into the first field. This was the url from the new repository on github that I also used in terminal got clone repository url\nmodifying the site layout While I like the Academic theme, there are many sections that are not relevant to me as I am a learner rather than a teacher. I am therefore modifying the layout to remove the pr-edefined sections such as Teaching, Publications, Recent and Upcoming Talks, Biography. I have to play around with it to figure it all out. The layout is specified in the config.toml file while the contents are under content / home. I can add sections I presume following the same format and file system. I have deleted several of the included files in the content/home folder. Specifically talks.md, teaching.md, talks_selected.md, skills.md, publications.md, publications_seleted.md, contact.md, experience.md\nI added a new section by essentially copying the teaching.md file which is an example of using the custom widget to create your own homepage section\nI amended the contact widget in contact.md active = false. I also set active= false in the hero.md file\nlatest site update I am happy enough now that I have the blog up and running. There are a few more modifications I will make to personalise the site.
