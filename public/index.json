The logo file is kept in the /static/ folder save your logo image into the static folder. in the config.toml file go down to [params.logo] and change the default url to the name of your image to be used as the logo. in my case \u0026ldquo;rocco2.png\u0026rdquo;\nchoosing a theme I have considered various themes to try out by looking at some other blogs. Some of the ones that I like are Beautiful Hugo, Blackburn and also Academic but I feel that I am not academic enough to be using Academic! What I want is a simple page where I keep my learning efforts / posts and be able to find them easily. The Academic theme seems to have a section with a menu on the right that is easy to navigate. I could just remove the sections that are not relevant to me.\ncontinuous deployment I had problems on an earlier version of the blog where continuous deployment was failing. For this version I started a new project using the git version control option and copied the git repository url into the first field. This was the url from the new repository on github that I also used in terminal got clone repository url\nmodifying the site layout While I like the Academic theme, there are many sections that are not relevant to me as I am a learner rather than a teacher. I am therefore modifying the layout to remove the pr-edefined sections such as Teaching, Publications, Recent and Upcoming Talks, Biography. I have to play around with it to figure it all out. The layout is specified in the config.toml file while the contents are under content / home. I can add sections I presume following the same format and file system. I have deleted several of the included files in the content/home folder. Specifically talks.md, teaching.md, talks_selected.md, skills.md, publications.md, publications_seleted.md, contact.md, experience.md\nI added a new section by essentially copying the teaching.md file which is an example of using the custom widget to create your own homepage section\nI amended the contact widget in contact.md active = false. I also set active= false in the hero.md file\n","date":1543536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543536000,"objectID":"8d29d4a2d1a7696565b13fccb2ecc77d","permalink":"/post/setting-up-the-blog/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/setting-up-the-blog/","section":"post","summary":"I am referring primarily to the Blogdown book by Yihue to build this website.
